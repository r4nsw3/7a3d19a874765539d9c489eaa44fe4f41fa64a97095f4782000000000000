  |   The Tetris 99 digital game includes an online mode that is a          |
  |   special offer for Nintendo Switch Online members. In large-scale,     |
  |   99-player battles, it'll take speed, skill, and strategy to knock     |
  |   out the competition and become the last player standing. You can      |
  |   target opponents by sending them Garbage Blocks, but be careful...    |
  |   Your rivals can target you back! Defeat opponents to acquire K.O.     |
  |   Badges that may give you the advantage on future attacks. Nintendo    |
  |   Switch Online members can also look forward to upcoming online        |
  |   events!                                                               |
